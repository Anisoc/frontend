      The Anime and Animation society is an appreciation society for all
      Japanese (and inspired) media, primarily anime. We want to provide a warm
      community and a safe chill space to wind down from the hustle and bustle
      of university life with both relaxing and out-there anime. With weekly
      online screenings (and in-person casual meet-ups), we hope to give you a
      comfortable space to explore, and make new friends and discover all things
      anime and manga! We have many upcoming events throughout the year,
      primarily at Halloween and Christmas, and smaller events will be scattered
      in both semesters, covering a range of activities. In the past, we've done
      everything from bowling to ice-skating to karaoke to bubble tea mixing!

      We know everyone has been through a rough time with COVID, and we as a
      society want to continue to be a safe place where everyone comes to relax.
      As such, we’re hosting screenings online for semester 1, and doing a mix
      of virtual and IRL events over this coming year. All our in-person events
      will follow COVID safety guidelines - sanitiser, facemasks, and social
      distancing when indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      We screen a variety of genres throughout the year, so that we can make
      sure there’s something for everyone; from action shounen shows, to
      rom-coms, to out-there sci-fi, we watch it all!
